Hello I am Rishabh Baid, a 3rd year cse student at iiit una, I am Interested in the backend position, so I have completed the backend assignment. 
I have made the script in nodejs, which uses cheerio for parsing the HTML and node-fetch to
make the http calls. our application start's with index.js file which first imports the scraper class which contains all the logic for scraping, then
I am handling all the exit events the could lead to exit our process, after that I have created and started a function which initializes and starts our scraper
then I have handled the exit event on which it saves the data in csv file, now let's look over the scraper class in scraper.js, I have imported load func from cheerio
which load's the html, fetch from node-fetch which makes http call, and fs which let's us reading and writing data to files, out init function get's the total no of pages
to scrape and then it will start scraping page ...explain concurrency of 5.
